* Description
  GladRL is a simple ASCII (ncurses-based) game engine written as a kind of Rust
  self-tutorial.  Warning: GladRL may not be fun.

  I didn't write any of the game content.  Instead, GladRL runs on top of the
  assets for the classic 1995 DOS game "Gladiator" by Forgotten Sages games, now
  GPL-licensed and maintained under the name [[https://github.com/openglad/openglad][OpenGlad]].  Those assets are all in
  the ~glad3.8~ directory.
* Install
  1. [[https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html][Install Rust]].
  2. Type ~make run~
* Playing
  The game runs until your team is defeated, then loops again from the start.

  You might want to modify ~config/keybindings.csv~ which currently features a
  Nethack-like control scheme:

* Description
  GladRL is a simple ASCII (ncurses-based) game engine written as a kind of Rust
  self-tutorial.  I didn't write any of the game content.  Instead, GladRL runs
  on top of the [[https://github.com/riscy/gladrl/tree/master/glad3.8][assets]] for the classic 1995 DOS game "Gladiator" by Forgotten
  Sages games, now GPL-licensed and maintained as [[https://github.com/openglad/openglad][OpenGlad]].
* Install
  1. [[https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html][Install Rust]].
  2. Type ~make run~
* Playing
  The game runs until your team is defeated.  The easiest way to play is to just
  press ~;~ repeatedly, and the game will play itself for you.  Otherwise use
  the Nethack-like control scheme described below, or modify
  ~config/keybindings.csv~ to your liking.
